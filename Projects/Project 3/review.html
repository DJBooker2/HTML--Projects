    <p>
      The dark knight is my favorite movie based on the simple but powerful
      message that it provides. It is about a man who literally lost everything
      and was forced to wake up and face what the world has to offer. Instead of
      choosing to let it cosume him and give up, he became a beacon of hope that
      everyone can look up to. Yes, his methods wern't, how do you say
      "traditional", but at the end of the day he never killed anyone. Even
      after all the terrible things that the joker did he still couldnt kill him
      because it wasn't the right thing to do. Even in darkness you can not
      loose yourself. That is something i had to learn in the military and its
      something ill never forget.
