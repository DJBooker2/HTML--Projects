            <h1>Georgia Gwinnett College</h1>
            <h2>Welcome to the future of education. Your education</h2>

            <p>A few years ago, Georgia Gwinnett College was home to just over 100 students. Let’s just say – things
                have changed.
                What was once 261 acres of rolling terrain has become the perfect metropolitan college campus of 12,831
                students.
                What’s so perfect about it? GGC adapts to how you do things – your learning style, your work schedule
                and your life.
                From the ground up, GGC was designed to help you succeed. That's game changing.</p>

            <h2>Founded</h2>
            <p>In 1994, Gwinnett County was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a four-year college. So
                Gwinnett County
                leaders purchased 160 acres of land and designated it specifically for the development of a college
                campus. GGC opened
                its doors in 2006 as the first four-year college founded in Georgia in more than 100 years, and the
                first four-year, public
                college created in the U.S. in the 21st century. Georgia Gwinnett College is a member of the University
                System of Georgia.</p>
