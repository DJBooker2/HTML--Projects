    <h1>Welcome to the future of education.
        Your education.</h1>

    <del>A few</del>15 years ago, <b><i>Georgia Gwinnett College</i></b> was home to just over
    <small><small>100</small></small> students.
    Let’s just say – things have changed. What was once 261 <sub>acres</sub> of rolling terrain
    has become the perfect <sup>metropolitan</sup> college campus of 12,831 students.
    <blockquote><b>What’s so perfect about it?</b> <i>GGC adapts to how you do things – your learning style,
            your work schedule and your life.</i> </blockquote>
    From the ground up, GGC was designed to help you <ins>succeed</ins>.
    That's <mark>game changing</mark>.
